# Analysis of Medieval Arabic Creations

Abstract
Authorship attribution is a challenging task in text classification, particularly in the context of medieval Arabic literature, due to the language's stylistic diversity, morphological richness, and the lack of standardized orthography. This project focuses on distinguishing authentic works of Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali from pseudo-authentic texts using advanced machine learning techniques. A computational framework is proposed, integrating Siamese Networks, AraBERT embeddings, and signal representation to analyze and capture distinct stylistic markers of authorship. The framework includes a systematic preprocessing pipeline tailored for Arabic texts and applies clustering methods to classify texts into authentic and pseudo-authentic groups. By leveraging techniques such as CNN and BiLSTM in the core model, the approach is designed to enhance accuracy and scalability in authorship attribution. This research contributes to the fields of computational linguistics and historical text analysis, offering a robust solution to the complexities of Arabic manuscript authenticity.
